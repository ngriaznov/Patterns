Patterns Teensy Sketch
===================


This is a simple sketch, playing various trigger patterns based on Euclidian (and possibly others) trigger pattern generation algorithms.

This is based on stable MIDI clock implementation: https://github.com/ngriaznov/LittleClock

----------

I'm using it with [Shuttle Control](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/endorphin-es-shuttle-control) module to produce stable gates and clocks. Patterns are generated randomly and switched every 16 bars. Everything is very alpha and shouldn't be used in real world scenarios yet.
